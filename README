                             XBASE Version 2.0.0
                             
                             
                             
WHAT IS IT?
-----------

XBase is an xbase (i.e. dBase, FoxPro, etc.) compatible C++ class library 
originally by Gary Kunkel and others (see the AUTHORS file).

XBASE is useful for accessing data in legacy dBase 3 and 4 database files as
well as a general light-weight database engine.  It includes support for
DBF (dBase version 3 and 4) data files, NDX and NTX indexes, and DBT 
(dBase version 3 and 4).  It supports file and record locking under *nix
OS's (we hope to fix the locking support under Win32 soon).


DIRECTORY LAYOUT
----------------

    /bin        contains various utility programs
    /examples   contains various test programs
    /html       contains the original xBase documentation in html format
    /tv         turbo vision interface stuff
    /xbase      XBase source and header files


BUILDING THE LIBRARY ON UNIX/LINUX
----------------------------------

XBase uses autoconf and libtool to manage the build process.

To configure the library for your specific system, run the "configure"
shell script as follows:

    ./configure
    
The configure script accepts the following options in addition to the
normal default options:

  --enable-debug 	  creates debugging code [default=no]
  --enable-shared         build shared libraries [default=yes]
  --enable-static         build static libraries [default=no]
  --with-gnu-ld           assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]
  --without-index-ndx     do not compile .ndx index support 
  --without-index-ntx     do not compile .ntx index support 
  --without-memo-fields   do not compile memo fields support 
  --without-expressions   do not compile expressions support 
  --without-ui-html       do not compile HTML support 
  --without-xbase-locking turn off XBase file locking 
  --without-realdelete     turn off XBase record deletion 
  --without-xbase-debug   turn off XBase specific debug 
  --with-exceptions       turn on exceptions 
  --with-castellano       turn on spanish date logic 

Once configured, execute make as follows to build the library:

    make
    
Once compiled (and assuming no errors occurred), use make to install the 
library, header files, and utilities as follows:

    make install
    
The default install directory is /usr/local.  


BUILDING THE LIBRARY ON WINDOWS
-------------------------------

If using the MINGW32 GCC compiler package, use the makefile.g95 make files.
Edit bin/makefile.g95 xbase/makefile.g95 to change installation directories.

If using the CYGWIN environment, use the makefile.cyg make files (or fix
the autoconf/automake stuff to work correclty).  However, for some reason
(as yet undetermined) it seems to run very slowly when compiled with the
cygwin compiler (perhaps the file handing in the cygwin dll is just dog slow?).


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The documentation at this point consists of the original xBase documentation
(in the html directory).  It is still very useful as little has changed 
from the original library except bugfixes and a few enhancements.

We are working on incorporating comments into the source to allow
generation of reference documentation using the Doxygen document generator.
A small amount has been done already, but we hope to complete this effort
before the next release.

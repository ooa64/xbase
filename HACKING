HACKING - 2/14/99

Here are notes relative to working on the Xbase library


1) update the --version-info field item in xbase/Makefile.am whenever 
   the interface changes

   Here are simple guidelines, taken from libtool docs:

   -version-info flag accepts an argument of the form
   `CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]'.  So, passing `-version-info 3:12:1' sets
   CURRENT to 3, REVISION to 12, and AGE to 1.

   If the library source code has changed at all since the last
   update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').

   If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
   last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.

   If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
   then increment AGE.

   If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
   then set AGE to 0.


2) Update the changelog file and log your changes

3) Update or create documentation if relevant - see html directory

4) Oh, and test your changes

I started thinking of a test suite.  DejaGNU looks like an overkill.
Instead I thought of record-by-line dump utility and diff...

If you make changes to the expression logic,  please add your new expression
module to the exptest.cpp program.  This program tests all expressions
known to xbase.

   This directory contains the germ of an command processing enviroment. yBase
 will be a FoxPro-like command enviroment. For now yBase can only execute
 a small subset of FoxBase programs.


 What is necessary to compile yBase?
 -----------------------------------

 To compile the source code you will need:
   - C++ compiler with accessories (for example GCC)
   - the xBase library (version 1.9.3 or newer)
 Both analyzers (lexical and syntactic) are already genereated. But if you
 want to generate the analyzers yourself, you will need:
   - FLEX (the GNU lexical analyzer generator)
   - BISON (the GNU parser generator)


 Usage:
 ------

 ./ybase -[vh] file

   -v    display version number
   -h    show help
   file  file to be processed (obligatory)


 What is aready done?
 --------------------

   - user guide
   - type Logical, Date, Numeric and Character
   - operators ( + - * / % < > <= >= <> # $ )
   - variables + system constants (PI,E)
   - some system functions
   - some database commands
   - assignments from/to variable/database
   - WHILE and IF commands


 What will be done in next versions?
 -----------------------------------

   - indexes and memo support
   - testing, code cleanup
   - more commands and functions
   - interactive mode (like FoxBase)
   - compiler mode (like FoxPro)


 And what will never be done?
 ----------------------------

   - & macros (it's practically impossible to implement this)


 What is new in this version?
 ----------------------------

   V 0.1.1   18/10/99   - xbDate and xbString support
                        - first database commands and functions
                        - more system functions
                        - first user guide
   V 0.1     20/09/99   - pre-prerelease

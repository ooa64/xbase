<p align="center">Chapter Updated 2/12/99</p><hr>

The objective of this chapter is to provide information regarding the
basic concepts of how .NTX index files work in the Xbase environment.<br><br>

The information in this chapter has been gathered by searching the internet
and by examining the structure of known good NTX indexes.<br><br>

<h4>NTX Index File Characteristics</h4>

<ul><li>NTX indices maintain keys in ascending sort order only.<br><br>
<li>NTX indices support <em>unique</em> or <em>non unique</em> keys.<br><br>

<em>Unique</em> keys must be unique. The database update routines will 
fail if an attempt to add a non-unique key is performed.<br><br>

<em>Non-unique</em> Keys are not required to be unique, duplicate
keys are allowed if the index is created with the XB_NOT_UNIQUE
setting.  Duplicate keys are stored in record number order.<br><br>

<li>NTX indexes are automatically updated by the Xbase library after the
indices are opened.<br><br>

<li>Character keys are left justified and padded on the right with spaces.<br><br>

<li>Numeric keys are stored as eight byte double values.<br><br>

The numeric key processing logic performs floating point numeric 
calculations on eight byte double values.  This logic may be compute intensive
and slow on older machines, especially the older intel processors without a 
math coprocessor chip.

</ul>


<h4>NTX File Internals</h4>

NTX files are comprised of two or more 1024 byte blocks or nodes of 
information.  There are three types of nodes: Head Nodes, Interior
Nodes and Leaf Nodes.<br><br>

The <em>Head Node</em> is the first node in the file starting at 
position zero (0) and contains information about the NTX file. There
is only one Head Node in each index and it always starts at the
beginning of the file.<br><br>

    xbUShort Signature;           /* Clipper 5.x or Clipper 87      */
    xbUShort Version;             /* Compiler Version               */
                                  /* Also turns out to be           */
                                  /* a last modified counter        */
    xbULong StartNode;            /* Offset in file for first node  */

    unsigned  Unique;             /* Unique Flag                    */
    char NotUsed[745];
};

<h4>Interior and Leaf Nodes</h4>

NTX files use a B-tree system to store keys. A B-tree is a balanced,
on disk tree who's design minimizes disk access. Interior Nodes and
Leaf Nodes share the same structure in an NTX file. The difference is
that interior nodes point to other nodes. Leaf nodes point to
nothing. Keys in both interior nodes and leaf nodes point to records
in a DBF file.

Interior nodes have field LeftNodeNo valued which points to the node
which points to the keys which are less than the key value in the KeyVal
field.  There is one more LeftNodeNo value in the node than there are keys.  The
Last LeftNodeNo points to the node which is greater than the highest
key value in the node.  <br><br>

Leaf nodes have 0 in the LeftNodeNo field.<br><br>


<TABLE BORDER>
<CAPTION ALIGN="TOP"><h3>NTX Interior Node and Leaf Node Structure</H3></CAPTION>
<TR VALIGN="BASELINE">
<TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT">Type<TD>Size<TD>Field Name<TD>Description
<TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT">xbShort<TD>2<TD>NoOfKeysThisNode<TD>The number of key values in  this node. (N)
<TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT">Array of xbUShort<TD>2<TD>offsets[]<TD>Array of 
    <pre>HeadNode.KeysPerNode +1</pre> unsigned longs. 
 These values are the offsets (in bytes) of each key 
 in this node, from the beginning of the node.
<TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT">char<TD>variable<TD>KeyRecs<TD>A repeating structure of
 pointers and keys.  See the next table for the KeyRec structure.
</TABLE>
<br><br>

One primary difference between NDX files and NTX files is that NTX
files uses an array of offsets on all interior and leaf nodes. Each
offset is the byte count from the beginning of the node where each
KeyRec will be found.  The order of the array of offsets determines
the order of keys on a given node. When keys are added or deleted,
thus changing the order of the keys on a node, only the order of the
offset array is changed. All other key data is not moved. This results
in slightly better index performance.

For those interested in knowing how the Xbase DBMS manipulates and
navigates index files, the following discussion may be helpfull.<br><br>

Xbase DBMS navigates through NTX files by using an in-memory chain of
nodes of the current location / key in use.  It starts by reading the
Head Node of the index, which points to the first node of the
file. The first node of the file will be a leaf node if the index is
small or will be an interior node if the index has more than one leaf
node.  The first interior node is loaded into memory, added to the
node chain and points to the next node to read.  The node is made up
of one or more keys.  If it is a leaf node, the logic looks for a
matching key on the node.  It continues down the tree, adding the
nodes to the in-memory node chain until it reaches the correct 
node. If it finds a matching key in the leaf node, it returns a XB_FOUND
condition.  If it doesn't find an exact match in the leaf node, it
returns a XB_NOT_FOUND condition and stops on the key which is greater
than the search key given.

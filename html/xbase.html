Welcome to Xbase DBMS.  Xbase DBMS is a collection of specifications,
programs, utilities and a C++ class library for manipulating Xbase 
type datafiles and indices. Xbase has been developed and produced by 
several people from around the world using the internet. 

<br><br>
XBase DBMS was developed using Linux and has been ported to other Unix flavors 
and Windows. It currently includes routines to support multi-user access 
for .DBF databases, fields, Dbase III and IV memo fields (variable length 
fields), dates, record and file locking and (.NDX and .NTX) indices.  
As of release 1.7.4, Xbase is compatible with dBASE III data, index and 
memo fields and also has support for some dBASE IV features.

<br><br> 
If you are looking for database libraries in general, or need access to 
Xbase files in particular, give Xbase DBMS a try.
If you are a C programmer and new to C++ object oriented programming, Xbase 
for Linux is easy to learn and will help transition you to the world of 
object oriented programming (see the example programs). If you are an 
experienced programmer but have never programmed in "C/C++" before, this 
library should provide complete enough examples to get you started 
programming in "C/C++" with confidence.<br><br><br>
